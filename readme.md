# DimensionDoor

Based on the idea that the best plugin do one job and do it very well, DimensionDoor was born. DimensionDoor is a lightweight but powerful solution to managing multiple worlds, with full permissions support and is simple to configure.

## Requirements

- Bukkit Persistence needs to be configured in bukkit.yml
- If using MySQL for Persistence, you need a MySQL database
- If using Permissions any version above 2.5 will do (does work with GroupManager)
